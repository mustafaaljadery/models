    "# GRUs\n",
    "- They're the next innovation after LSTMs but before Transformers.\n",
    "- They are an adaptation of RNNs, similar to LSTMs\n",
    "- They have less tensor operators so they are speedier to train. \n",
    "- You can think of them as LSTMs without the short term memory, but they do more operations to the long term memory.\n",
    "- Researchers try both LSTMs and GRUs to see what works better for their usecase."
